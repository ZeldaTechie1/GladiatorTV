Steps to allow Github to work properly with Unity:

Go to the top left and click Edit->Project Settings-> Editor
Then make sure that Version Control Mode is set to Visible Meta Files
Finally make sure Asset Serialization Mode is set to Force Text

These might be done already because I updated the project on Github to have these settings but just make sure anyways!
